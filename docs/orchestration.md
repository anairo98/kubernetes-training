## Orchestration made easy with minikube 

The larger the sum of microservices that form an application, the more difficult it becomes to manually manage such an application and efficiently deploy resources and time.

Similar to a large container ship, central management (like a crew and a captain) becomes increasingly relevant with a higher number of containers. 

One of the most well-known open-source orchestration options is Kubernetes. Kubernetes operates in the form of a cluster, which consists of master or control nodes and worker nodes.

For practice purposes, it makes sense to map such a cluster in a small scale on a single node to save resources. At this point, the open-source software **Minikube** comes into play, allowing us to simulate such a Kubernetes cluster and practice with it.
