# Welcome to the world of Kubernetes

This guide is designed to help you get started with Kubernetes, the powerful open-source platform for automating microservice deployments, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Whether you're new to Kubernetes or looking to solidify your foundational knowledge, this training will provide you with the basic concepts and hands-on experience needed to start to utilize Kubernetes effectively.

## Workshop Structure

This training is designed to provide hands-on experience with Kubernetes, covering topics such as:
- Kubernetes architecture
- Deploying and managing applications
- Networking in Kubernetes
- Scaling and monitoring

## Prerequisites

Before starting the training, ensure you have:
- Basic knowledge of containers and Docker
- A working installation of Kubernetes (e.g., Minikube, Kind, or a cloud provider)
- Familiarity with the command line

## Hands-On Labs

For Hands-On-Labs, we provide two main usecases, one for building a container image of a simple web application. This use case is divided into two hands-on labs. In the first hands-on lab, **Docker** or **Podman** will be used, and in the second hands-on lab, a Kubernetes cluster will be set up with **Minikube**. The GitHub repository for the instructions and necessary files is linked below:

and another one, which show you how to deploy an e-commerce application with microservices architecture:
