# Welcome to the world of Kubernetes

This guide is designed to help you get started with Kubernetes, the powerful open-source platform for automating microservice deployments, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Whether you're new to Kubernetes or looking to solidify your foundational knowledge, this training will provide you with the basic concepts and hands-on experience needed to start to utilize Kubernetes effectively.

## Workshop Structure
This training is designed to provide hands-on experience with Kubernetes, covering topics such as:
- Kubernetes architecture
- Deploying and managing applications
