## Let's start with some Basics

The first part of this workshop will focus on the basic concepts of containerization with Docker or Podman. The theoretical content will be covered in the training itself, while this website will guide the hands-on labs step by step. Specifically, the first hands-on lab will involve building an image from a container file, running it in a container, and finally pushing this image to a repository like Docker Hub. 
You can create a Docker Hub account and start pushing images with the link below:
